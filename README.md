# OpenGL-ES-3D-Game-Engines

 * ### Description
  
   #### This repository contains the source code for a 3D Game Engine written in C++ using OpenGL ES . This Engine was made during a workshop organized by Gameloft. The workshop started on 15.10.2016 with the duration of 1 semester and was hosted at University Politehnica of Bucharest.
 
 * ### Bug Reporting
   
   #### If you see a bug please log it here [Issues](https://github.com/sulzandreig/OpenGL-ES-3D-Game-Engine/issues).
 
 * ### Contribution
   
   #### If you want to add new functionality or improve something please fork the project and send a pull request.
 
 * ### Purpose
   
   #### The purpose is to learn how to create a 3D Game Engine from scratch and have fun while doing it.
 
* ### Books usefull for this engine:

 * #### Features
     * #### Infinite terrain generation in XoZ plane 
     * #### Model loading for .nfg extension
     * #### Camera so we can move around X,Y,Z axes or into them
     * #### Trajectories for objects (Linear, Loop, LineStrip and Circle)
     * #### Fog
     * #### Skybox
     * #### AABB collision
     * #### Sounds with FMOD library
     * #### Fire
     * #### Partial or full skybox reflexion for objects
     * #### Postprocessing effects such as (blurr, greyscale, sharpen and any kind of postprocessing effect that has a convolution matrix of 3x3)
     * #### Multiple lights creation (currently we can have maximum 4, and they are point and directional)
     * #### Debug mode to help so find bugs (normals, wireframe, rgb axes, camera axes and AABB axes)
